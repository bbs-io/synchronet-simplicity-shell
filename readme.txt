S3 Command Shell v1.3 (for Synchronet 3.10k+)
===
NOTE: you need to remove the old sh_s3 from your
  SCFG->Command Shells, the file name(s) have changed

NOTE: if updating from v1.1.1, only need to change
  the s3.js from the s3__exec.zip file.
---
First, install the files in s3__utils.zip, you need
  to view the install.txt in this file.. you must
  have the entire s3_utils, (except for login.js)
  installed for the s3 shell to work best.
  
Second, unzip the contents of s3__text_menu_s3
  to ./text/menu/s3 (there are a couple new files)
  
Third, unzip the contents of s3__mods.zip
  to ./mods
  
Run SCFG->Command Shells
  move to the position you want to insert the s3
  shell into, and press INSERT on the keyboard
  
  Command Shell Name: S3 - Synchronet 3
  Command Shell Internal Code: S3
---
Enhancements include an updated whos online, and
new user creation, with prelogin-email validation.
